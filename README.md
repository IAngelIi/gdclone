<br />

**An attempt at an alternative GD client.**

Built using Bevy engine and Rust.

***2.2 support is planned and will (hopefully) be started and finished in the near future***

## Usage

**The version currently available in [releases](https://github.com/opstic/gdclone/releases) is a legacy version compiled
before the rewrite.**

**No binaries for the rewritten version are available for now.**

Controls are WASD to move, use arrow keys to move slower.

Q and E to zoom in and out.

U to unlink the camera from the simulated player.

L to disable player and camera line rendering.

~~Use Esc to exit out of a level.~~

~~Grab the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/opstic/gdclone/releases) then just run it.~~

~~A GD install and valid CCLocalLevels.dat are required.~~

~~**Binaries for Linux aren't available, so you'll need to compile it yourself.**~~

~~*Support for web and mobile platforms are planned.*~~
